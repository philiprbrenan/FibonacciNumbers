# Programming tests

These are the sorts of programs that one gets asked to write to demonstrate that one is a competent programmer - but competent programmers are always very busy on projects and have no time at all to do these kinds of tests. Conversely, incompetent programmers have plenty of time on their hands and so can easily take the time to look up solutions to problems like these or pay some-one to create a solution for them, which when you stop to think about it, is a very competent strategy indeed.

Therefore, in order to lay the scourge of programming tests aside forever, as in this day of the Internet they make no sense what-so-ever, please add all the programming tests that you have run into to this catalog so that it becomes a central reference for all such problems: a place where recruiters can easily find sample problems and programmers, competent or not, can just as easily find the answers to the selected problems.  Only in this way can we move to a system where published work is the only test for whether a programmer is competent or not.
